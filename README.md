## What is BAIA

The hotel industry runs on closed-source, legacy PMS platforms that charge per-room fees, lock data behind proprietary APIs, and treat integrations as an afterthought. Hotels pay $5–15/room/month just for the privilege of managing their own operations.

BAIA is a **complete, production-grade hotel Property Management System** built from scratch with modern architecture. Reservation lifecycle, folio & billing, rate plans, housekeeping with digital checklists, night audit, groups & commercial (allotment + rooming lists), accounting & cashiering (A/R, deposits, cash drawers, GL codes), channel distribution to 450+ OTAs, a **full commission-free direct booking engine** (guest-facing widget + public booking API) so hotels take reservations straight from their own website, **pluggable payment gateways** (Stripe and other PSPs), Keycloak authentication, local user & role administration, media management for property and room photos, tax calculation, fiscal invoicing & guest-registration providers, an **integration registry** for adapters and providers, door-lock credential hooks, revenue management — and **12 built-in AI agents** that orchestrate revenue strategy, optimize pricing, predict cancellations, detect audit anomalies, prioritize receivables collections, forecast group pickup, schedule housekeeping, automate guest communications, and draft review responses. It even ships a **ChatGPT gateway** so guests can search and book a room by chatting. Dashboard locales include English, German, and Portuguese (BR). All open source under Apache 2.0.

What makes BAIA different is that **AI agents are built into the architecture from day one** — not as a bolt-on, but as first-class citizens with their own lifecycle, decision logging, and per-property calibration (deterministic engines that learn each hotel's own rates from its history — not LLMs pretending to be agents). BAIA is the sister project to [OTAIP](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/otaip) (Open Travel AI Platform). Together they form **Telivity's open-source travel infrastructure**. OTAIP agents connect to BAIA via the Connect API — the PMS works without AI, but the AI makes it extraordinary.

### What BAIA is NOT

BAIA is not a wrapper around another PMS. It's not a SaaS dashboard with "AI" slapped on the marketing page. It's a real PMS with real hotel operations logic — night audits at 3am, folio routing rules, rate parity enforcement, guest registration compliance across jurisdictions. And it ships a **commission-free direct booking engine** so a hotel can take bookings straight from its own website — keeping the 15–25% an OTA would take.

**Option B Architecture** — The PMS is standalone. It works without OTAIP. OTAIP agents sit on top via the Connect API, using purpose-built endpoints for AI agent workflows.

### Key Design Decisions

- **Multi-tenant from day one** — `property_id` on every table, designed for portfolio operators managing multiple hotels
- **Event-driven** — Webhook events on every state change (`reservation.created`, `folio.charge_posted`, `room.status_changed`). Build anything on top.
- **AI agents as first-class citizens** — 12 built-in agents with a common interface: `analyze() → recommend() → execute()`, coordinated by a Revenue Manager orchestrator. Three operating modes: manual, suggest, autopilot. Decision logging for continuous learning.
- **ChannelAdapter pattern** — Same abstraction as OTAIP's ConnectAdapter. Booking.com + Expedia (EQC) direct adapters plus SiteMinder and DerbySoft aggregators for 450+ OTA reach — distributing **both** ARI and descriptive content (photos/descriptions/amenities).
- **Layered RBAC** — Keycloak JWT authentication **plus BAIA's own local users, roles & permissions**: a code-defined permission catalog, operator-defined custom roles, and guards (`@Roles` + `@RequirePermissions`) on every endpoint.
- **Polymorphic media** — One image model for properties, room types & rooms; add by URL (zero infra) or upload to S3/MinIO, with one enforced primary per owner.
- **Compliance as infrastructure** — PCI tokenization via pluggable payment gateways, GDPR audit trails, jurisdiction-based tax calculation, fiscal document hooks, guest registration per jurisdiction. Not bolted on — built in.
- **Integration registry** — channels, payments, messaging, fiscal, door locks, and more as discoverable adapters/providers — not one-off hardwires.
- **Real-time dashboard** — WebSocket broadcasting per property. Room status changes, new reservations, AI agent decisions — all pushed instantly.

## BAIA Agents

BAIA includes **12 built-in AI agents** — 5 for revenue management (including the Revenue Manager orchestrator), 5 for operations intelligence, and 2 for guest engagement. Every agent follows the `HaipAgent` interface:

```
analyze() → recommend() → execute() → recordOutcome() → train()
```

### Orchestration (BAIA-hosted)

BAIA orchestrates its own agents — there is no generic pipeline engine. **RManager** runs the revenue subgraph (`demand_forecast` → pricing / overbooking / channel_mix / group_pickup → one strategy). Ops and guest agents run on external cron or events. **OTAIP** orchestrates OTAIP agents over the Connect API only (Option B). Graph source of truth: `apps/api/src/modules/agent/agent-graph.ts`. Details: [`docs/agents-orchestration.md`](./docs/agents-orchestration.md).

### Operating Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Manual** | Agent analyzes and recommends. Human approves/rejects via dashboard. |
| **Suggest** | Agent recommends with confidence score. High-confidence decisions auto-execute. |
| **Autopilot** | Agent executes autonomously. All decisions logged for review. |

### Revenue Management Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Revenue Manager (RManager)** | The revenue **orchestrator**. Runs the levers below in dependency order (demand first, then pricing, overbooking, channel mix, group pickup) and reconciles them into one coherent strategy grounded in established RM doctrine: optimizes **GOPPAR** (profit per available room) over raw revenue, moves price with demand band and booking pace, protects peak dates with length-of-stay controls and zero overbooking, keeps the rate grid internally consistent, evaluates group displacement on net contribution, and treats discounting as a last resort. Surfaces conflicts between levers and projects RevPAR/GOPPAR across the horizon. |
| **Demand Forecasting** | Predicts future occupancy using weighted moving averages with day-of-week seasonality, booking pace, and last-minute demand signals. Heuristic model → statistical model progression. |
| **Dynamic Pricing** | Calculates optimal room rates based on demand tier, booking pace, lead-time decay, and weekend premiums. Enforces floor/ceiling rate constraints. |
| **Channel-Mix Optimization** | Ranks OTA channels by net revenue (gross × (1−commission) × (1−cancel_rate)). Recommends allocation shifts and stop-sell when occupancy exceeds thresholds. |
| **Overbooking Management** | Calculates optimal overbooking level using expected value optimization: (overbook revenue × fill probability) vs (walk cost × walk probability). Respects walk cost constraints. |

### Operations Intelligence Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Night Audit Anomaly Detection** | Scans checked-in reservations, folios, and closed cashier shifts for 8 anomaly types: unposted charges, missing tax, payment mismatches, stale check-ins, duplicate folios, no-show candidates, unusual charges, and cash-drawer variance outliers (z-score > 2.5 statistical outlier detection). Ranked by severity (critical/warning/info) and confidence. |
| **Housekeeping Optimization** | Builds workload-balanced cleaning schedules. Prioritizes VIP and early check-in rooms, groups by floor for route efficiency, estimates cleaning times by task type (checkout 30min, stayover 20min, deep clean 60min, suite 45min). |
| **Cancellation Prediction** | Scores every active reservation with a cancellation probability based on booking source (OTA 25% base vs direct 8%), deposit status, repeat guest history, VIP level, lead time, and days until arrival. Adds **deposit-forfeit risk** scoring on held deposits (likely-forfeit vs likely-refund exposure). Aggregates risk by date for overbooking decisions. |
| **A/R Collections Prioritization** | Ranks open Accounts Receivable ledgers by collection priority — weighing outstanding balance, days overdue beyond payment terms, and open transfer count — into low/medium/high risk tiers with a recommended action (monitor, send reminder, send final notice). |
| **Group Pickup Forecasting** | Projects final pickup vs. wash/attrition for each allotment block ahead of its cutoff date, using current pickup pace and historical pickup rate. Recommends hold / partial-release / full-release with a suggested release quantity to recover unsold inventory. |

### Guest Engagement Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| **Guest Communication** | Template-based lifecycle emails: confirmation, pre-arrival (3 days), day-of arrival, welcome (on check-in), post-stay, and win-back (90 days). **Event-driven drafts** on `reservation.created` / `checked_in` / `checked_out` via `GuestCommsListener`; scheduled types still from manual/cron `guest_comms/run`. Repeat vs first-time personalization. GDPR opt-out enforcement. Duplicate prevention via decision log. Configurable SMTP (defaults to draft-only). Outbound **SMS** and **WhatsApp** templates via Twilio providers (console fallback when not configured). |
| **Review Response** | Drafts professional responses to guest reviews entered by staff. Keyword-based topic extraction across 10 categories (cleanliness, staff, value, noise, food, wifi, etc.). Sentiment classification from rating (1-2 negative, 3 mixed, 4-5 positive). Three response styles (formal/friendly/casual). Matches guests to reservations for stay-specific references. Template-based assembly — no LLM freeform text, no hallucination risk. |

### Decision Logging & per-property calibration

Every agent decision is persisted (input snapshot, recommendation, confidence, outcome)
as an audit trail. On top of that, agents **calibrate to each property's own history**:
running `train()` recomputes an agent's parameters from that hotel's real outcomes and
stores them in `agent_configs.modelState`, which `analyze()` then uses instead of the
cold-start defaults.

> **What this is — and isn't (read this).** The agents are **deterministic decision
> engines**, not LLMs — that's the point: they're the auditable guardrail. "Learning" here
> means **statistical calibration from your hotel's own data** (e.g. the cancellation agent
> learns this property's real cancel rates by booking source), not a neural net. Today the
> cancellation agent calibrates for real; the other history-rich agents follow the same
> pattern. The customer-comms and review-response agents are deterministic templates (no
> LLM, no hallucination) and do **not** "learn."

#### What learns vs. what's deterministic

| Agent | Today |
|---|---|
| Cancellation Predictor | **Calibrates** per-property cancel rates by source from history |
| Demand · Overbooking · Channel Mix | Deterministic; same calibration pattern is the roadmap |
| Pricing · Revenue Manager · Group Pickup · AR · Housekeeping · Night Audit | Deterministic math/rules |
| Guest Comms · Review Response | Deterministic templates (no LLM) |

**BAIA AI (optional):** a small, purpose-built **local** model (served via Ollama) that
adds a plain-language *explanation + suggestions* layer over any agent decision — strictly
grounded in that agent's own numbers, with the deterministic agent vetoing any figure it
didn't compute (so it can't invent a rate, a policy, or a number). It **explains and
suggests; it never executes** — approval always runs the agent's own recommendation. It
runs entirely on the property's own hardware (no cloud calls, no per-use fees, and no guest
data leaves the building) and is **off by default** — the PMS works fully without it.

Enable it:

```bash
# pull the model (Apache-2.0, ~5 GB), then turn it on
ollama pull hf.co/telivity/haip-ai
export BAIA_AI_ENABLED=true
export BAIA_AI_MODEL=haip-ai
```

See **BAIA Agents** and [`docs/agents-orchestration.md`](./docs/agents-orchestration.md). |

### Direct Booking Engine (commission-free)
- A **public, guest-facing booking API** (`/api/v1/booking-engine/*`) a hotel puts behind its own website — search → quote → book → pay → confirm — capturing direct reservations with **zero OTA commission**.
- Authenticated by a per-property **publishable key** (`x-booking-key`): property-scoped, low-trust (it ships in client-side HTML), and restricted to search/quote/book and read-or-cancel-own-confirmation — it can never enumerate other reservations or tenants.
- Reuses the existing availability, rate, tax, reservation, folio and payment engines — prices are **re-quoted server-side** (never trusts a client price), payments are classified as a **deposit** liability (KB §10.5), and `reservation.created` fires so the channel manager pushes updated availability everywhere.
- **Embeddable widget app** (`apps/booking`) plus a dashboard **Settings → Booking Engine** tab to generate/rotate keys, choose sellable room types & rates, set branding, and configure the deposit policy.
- **Deep links** — build guest-facing search/book URLs (property, dates, occupancy, optional room/rate preselect, click attribution) for the hotel’s own booking page.

### Data Migration & Import
- A generic **CSV import** on-ramp (`/api/v1/import/*`) for hotels switching from another PMS: upload a CSV, map columns, **dry-run** to validate, then commit — with **per-row error reporting** (one bad row never aborts the batch). Importers for guests, room types and rate plans, trivially extensible to more entities.

### Accounting Export
- Plain **CSV export** of the daily revenue journal and trial balance (`/api/v1/accounting-export/*`) to import into your own books (QuickBooks/Xero/spreadsheet) — no hosted connector required.

### Reservation Management
- Full lifecycle state machine: `pending → confirmed → assigned → checked_in → stayover → due_out → checked_out`
- Real-time availability engine with room type inventory
- Room assignment with automatic status transitions
- **Front desk stay ops** — arrivals / in-house queues (multi-status filters), walk-in create→assign→check-in, in-house **room move** (`PATCH …/move-room`, respects `doNotMove`), operational notes at the desk and on reservation detail
- **Guest registration at check-in** — registration card fields + `registrationSigned`; required when the property has `guestRegistrationRequired`
- Group check-in (batch operations)
- Bulk actions across multiple reservations (check-in / check-out / cancel) with per-reservation success/error results
- Reservation notes with active-count tracking
- Guest messaging from a reservation (email / SMS / WhatsApp templates; GDPR marketing opt-out enforced)
- Advance **pre-register** fields on a reservation before arrival
- **Waitlist** — non-deducting entries (offer → convert to a real reservation when inventory allows)
- **Turnaways** — append-only denied / regret demand with reason codes and summary reporting
- Unassigned-reservation finder (confirmed/assigned reservations with no room)
- Batch reservation import with per-row error handling
- Express checkout
- **Money policy** — property cancellation policies (free-cancel window, penalty type, deposit handling) linked from rate plans; shared evaluator for PMS / Connect / booking engine; deposit settlement on cancel, no-show, and check-in auto-apply
- No-show and cancellation handling with policy enforcement (reservation "un-cancel" is intentionally unsupported — a payment-integrity hazard; create a new reservation instead)
- Every state transition fires a webhook event and is audit-logged

### Stay Extras & Packages (Upsells)
- Property **services catalog** — sellable extras with charge type, price, posting rule (`once` / `per_night` / `on_consumption` / `included_in_rate`), and sell channels (`booking_engine` / `front_desk` / `pre_arrival`)
- **Package rate plans** can bundle catalog services as components
- Attach extras to a reservation from front desk or booking; price snapshot + status lifecycle
- **Posting** — check-in posts `once` / included lines; night audit posts `per_night` (idempotent); folio routing and tax apply as usual
- Booking engine + embeddable widget optional extras step; guest-comms can prompt pre-arrival upsells when enabled

### Folio & Billing
- Guest folios, master folios, and city ledger accounts
- Charge posting with department codes and revenue categories
- Charge routing rules (e.g., room & tax to company, incidentals to guest)
- Charge reversal, transfer between folios, and city ledger transfer
- Folio settlement and close workflows
- Charge locking for night audit
- **Transfer folio balance to A/R** from folio detail (direct-bill handoff)
- **Inbound posting** — property-scoped webhook posts (e.g. phone / minibar) onto the in-house guest folio, idempotent by vendor transaction id

### Split Folios & House Accounts
- **Split folio** — multiple folios per reservation with config-driven routing rules (e.g. room & tax → company folio, incidentals → guest folio) and the ability to move transactions between folios individually or by charge type (night-audit-locked charges are protected).
- **House accounts** — a non-guest ledger for walk-in retail, bar/restaurant, vendor, or internal sales not tied to any reservation. Open/close lifecycle, a product catalog for retail sales, and charge/payment posting on the same unified ledger as folios (keeps room vs. non-room revenue distinct in reports).
- **Correction matrix** — a payment-state-aware correction policy that picks the safe operation automatically: **void** uncaptured authorizations (and same-day cash), **refund** captured card payments, or post a compensating **adjustment** when neither applies. Illegal overrides (e.g. voiding a captured card) are rejected.

### Groups & Commercial Profiles
- **Group profiles** — master records for corporate, travel-agent, wholesale, and event business, with an optional group (master) folio and computed group invoices.
- **Commercial standing accounts** — billing address + payment terms on group profiles; optional links from **A/R ledgers** and **negotiated rate plans** (`groupProfileId`); Commercial dashboard page lists corporate / travel-agent / wholesale accounts and can create a linked A/R ledger (`GET /groups/profiles/:id/commercial`).
- **Allotment blocks** — hold a quantity of rooms per date and room type at negotiated rates, with cutoff dates, shoulder dates, and Min/Max LOS. Inventory is validated against live availability so a block can't over-allot.
- **Cutoff & auto-release** — release unsold rooms back to general inventory at the cutoff date, per block or via a sweep endpoint that processes all expired auto-release blocks.
- **Pickup tracking** — rooms allotted vs. picked up, per date and room type, with pickup rate.
- **Rooming lists** — batch-import a group's guest roster; each row creates and links a reservation and increments pickup, with per-row success/error handling that never aborts the batch.

### Accounting & Cashiering
- **Deposit Ledger** — advance deposits tracked as a liability (not revenue) with a full recognition lifecycle: `held → applied` (at check-in/checkout), `refunded`, or `forfeited`. Refundable vs. non-refundable handling, with status-transition guards. Cancel/no-show/check-in settlement follows the property money policy.
- **Accounts Receivable** — named A/R ledgers for post-stay direct billing; transfer an outstanding folio balance to A/R (zeroing the folio), record A/R payments, reverse transfers with a preserved audit trail, aging buckets (0–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 / 90+), and property-wide aging (`GET /ar/aging`). Dashboard create/close ledgers and reverse-transfer picker via `GET /ar/ledgers/:id/transactions`.
- **Cash Drawer & Cashiering** — per-drawer cash tracking with shift sessions, cash movements (payment, refund, paid-out, drop), shift close with expected-vs-counted **variance** detection, and a cashier's report. Dashboard lists drawers (`GET /cash/drawers`) and can resume open sessions (`GET /cash/sessions`) using the drawer starting float.
- **Daily Trial Balance** — reconciliation across the Deposit, Guest, and A/R ledgers (opening + activity = closing).
- **Custom Accounting Codes** — user-defined transaction and General Ledger (GL) codes for export to external accounting systems.

### Rate Plans & Pricing
- BAR (Best Available Rate), derived rates, and negotiated rates
- Rate derivation: amount or percentage adjustments from parent plans
- Restrictions: MinLOS, MaxLOS, CTA (Closed to Arrival), CTD (Closed to Departure), stop-sell (`isClosed`), optional day-of-week overrides — dashboard detail panel + existing REST sub-resource
- Effective rate calculation (resolves derived parent chain); calculator UI passes `propertyId` and reads `effectiveRate`
- PMS reservation create enforces restrictions via `RatePlanService.assertSellable` (same gate as Connect / booking-engine BOOK)
- Occupancy-based rate adjustments

### Room Management
- Room type configuration with amenities, max occupancy, and base rates
- Room status state machine: `vacant_clean → occupied → vacant_dirty → clean → inspected → guest_ready`
- Connecting room support
- ADA/accessible room tracking
- Real-time status summary dashboard
- Per-room photo and editable features/amenities from the room detail panel (primary image falls back to the room type's photo)
- **Discrepancy workflow** — housekeeping occupancy observation vs front-office in-house state; open cases with resolve / dismiss; open-count for night audit
- Optional door-lock credential issuance hooks for in-house stays

### Media & Photos
- Image management for **properties, room types, and rooms** — a polymorphic `media` model with a denormalized `property_id` on every row for multi-tenant scoping
- Add images **by URL** (zero infra) or **upload files** to S3-compatible object storage (AWS S3 / MinIO) when configured — the driver is selected by env, so the default demo runs on stock URLs with no storage backend and no committed binaries
- Per-owner ordering, captions, alt text, and categories (hero, exterior, room, amenity, dining), with a single enforced **primary** image per owner (partial unique index)
- Dashboard photo galleries wired into Room Types, individual Rooms, and Property Settings — reorder, set-primary, and delete
- Image mutations are admin-gated; reads are available to any authenticated user

### Guest Profiles
- Full guest profiles with contact, preferences, company, and stay history
- ID document fields captured at check-in (type, number, issuing country, expiry) and shown on the guest profile
- VIP level tracking (standard, silver, gold, platinum, diamond)
- Loyalty membership number on the guest profile
- **Loyalty points ledger** — organization-scoped program, guest accounts, earn / burn / adjust transactions (burn as folio rebate)
- Do Not Rent (DNR) flagging
- GDPR consent tracking (including marketing opt-in/out) and data retention controls
- Property setting `guestRegistrationRequired` — when on, check-in requires a signed registration card
- Guest search with flexible filters

### Housekeeping
- Task CRUD with 6 task types: checkout clean, stayover, deep clean, inspection, turndown, maintenance
- Auto-task creation on checkout (event-driven via `room.status_changed`)
- Digital checklists with templates per task type
- ADA and VIP-aware checklist augmentation (automatic extra items)
- Staff assignment, auto-assignment (round-robin by floor/priority), and workload tracking
- Task lifecycle: `pending → assigned → in_progress → completed → inspected`
- Inspection pass/fail with automatic re-clean on failure
- Room status integration — completing a task transitions the room through `clean → inspected → guest_ready`
- Stayover task generation for occupied rooms
- **Lost & found** — held / returned / disposed items, including baggage / parcel / valet categories
- **Service requests** — maintenance and guest-service tickets linked to rooms / reservations
- Dashboard with room summary, task summary, housekeeper performance, and urgent rooms
- Analytics: average turn time, median turn time, inspection pass rate, maintenance issue rate, breakdown by room type and housekeeper

### Night Audit & Reporting
- Automated night audit: room revenue posting, no-show processing, rate validation, day close
- AI anomaly detection: 8 anomaly types (incl. cash-drawer variance) with severity ranking and confidence scores
- Daily revenue reports with department breakdown
- Occupancy reports with ADR (Average Daily Rate) and RevPAR
- Financial summaries with revenue categories
- Occupancy trend analysis over date ranges
- KPI dashboard in the admin UI

### Channel Manager
- ARI (Availability, Rates, Inventory) push to connected OTAs
- **Content distribution** — push descriptive content (photos, descriptions, amenities) to OTAs via each adapter's content API, with content-sync logging and **auto-resync** when property or media content changes (`property.content_updated` / `roomtype.content_updated` events)
- Channel connection management with credentials and mapping
- Inbound reservation processing from OTA channels
- Reservation pull from channels
- Rate parity monitoring and enforcement
- Rate override capabilities per channel
- Stop-sell functionality
- Sync logging for audit trails (ARI **and** content pushes)

#### OTA Adapters

| Adapter | Type | Coverage |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Booking.com** | Direct integration | OTA XML for ARI + inbound reservation webhooks/cancellations; JSON **Photo API** for content (photos with validation, plus room/property descriptions & amenities). |
| **Expedia (EQC)** | Direct integration | EQC Availability & Rates (XML) for ARI, Booking Notification push for inbound reservations, and the **Image API** for content (with Expedia's own image limits). |
| **SiteMinder** | Aggregator (pmsXchange) | SOAP / OTA XML. Connect once, distribute to 450+ OTAs — ARI push, reservation delivery, rate parity. (Content is managed in the SiteMinder extranet — no PMS content push.) |
| **DerbySoft** | Aggregator (Property Connector) | REST/JSON + OAuth Bearer. ARI (inventory/rate/availability) with Delta/Overlay, property profile sync, inbound LiveCheck/Book/Modify/Cancel. See [`docs/channels/derbysoft.md`](./docs/channels/derbysoft.md). |

Operator notes for activating existing adapters, metasearch landings on the direct booking engine, and GDS via a channel manager: [`docs/channels/`](./docs/channels/).

### Payments (pluggable gateways)
- PCI DSS compliant — never stores raw card data
- Pluggable payment gateway adapters — **Stripe** is the default full path (PaymentIntents, customer creation, tokenization); additional PSP adapters are available via the integration registry
- Authorization, capture, void, and refund workflows
- Payment recording with method tracking (card, cash, bank transfer)
- Linked to folio charges

### Tax Calculation Engine
- Jurisdiction-based tax rules (state, city, county levels)
- Tax types: sales tax, occupancy/lodging tax, tourism tax, VAT
- Inclusive and exclusive tax calculation
- Rate-based and fixed-amount taxes
- Tax-exempt guest handling
- Automatic tax application on charge posting
- Tax breakdown on folio output

### Authentication & Authorization (Keycloak)
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect via Keycloak identity provider
- JWT validation with RS256 public key verification
- Keycloak roles (`admin`, `front_desk`, `housekeeping`, `revenue_manager`) **plus BAIA's own local roles & permissions** (see *Users, Roles & Permissions* below)
- `@Roles()` and `@RequirePermissions()` decorators guard every controller
- `@Public()` decorator for unauthenticated endpoints (health checks)
- `@CurrentUser()` decorator for extracting authenticated user context

### Users, Roles & Permissions (Admin Console)
- **Local identity & authorization** layered on top of Keycloak login — BAIA owns its own `users`, `roles`, `role_permissions`, and `user_roles` tables (property-scoped, multi-tenant)
- **Code-defined permission catalog** (e.g. `reservations.write`, `rooms.read`, `housekeeping.manage`, `channels.manage`, `media.manage`, `admin.users.manage`) mapped 1:1 to API capabilities and dashboard nav items
- **Custom roles** — operators create roles and grant granular permissions via a permission matrix; built-in system roles are protected from edits/deletion
- `PermissionsGuard` + `@RequirePermissions()` augment the Keycloak JWT guard; permissions drive both API authorization **and** which nav items/pages each user sees
- **Admin console** in Settings: a **Users** tab (create/invite users, assign roles) and a **Roles** tab (permission matrix)
- Works fully in the demo with `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (all permissions granted); binds to Keycloak subjects when auth is enabled

### Webhook Engine
- Real-time webhook delivery on every entity state change
- 73 event types including accounting events (`deposit.received`, `ar.transfer_created`, `cashdrawer.session_closed`), house-account & folio events (`houseaccount.opened`, `folio.transactions_moved`, `payment.corrected`), fiscal document events (`invoice.requested`, `invoice.issued`, `invoice.voided`), group events (`group.block_created`, `group.rooming_list_imported`), reservation-ops events (`reservation.note_added`, `reservation.message_sent`, `reservation.bulk_action_completed`), and AI agent events (`agent.decision_made`, `agent.cancellation_forecast_updated`, `guest.communication_drafted`, `guest.review_response_drafted`)
- Event format: `entity.action` (e.g., `reservation.created`, `housekeeping.task_completed`)
- Subscription management for external consumers
- HMAC-signed deliveries with retries; permanent failures raise a critical staff notification
- See **[`docs/webhooks.md`](./docs/webhooks.md)** for the integration guide (signature verification, payload conventions, fiscal documents, regional compliance examples)

### ChatGPT Gateway (Connect GPT)
- A standalone, deployable **gateway that exposes BAIA hotel search & booking as a ChatGPT Custom GPT Action** (`tools/haip-connect-gpt`) — guests search availability and create/modify/cancel reservations by chatting
- A thin, typed client over BAIA's existing **Connect API** (`/api/v1/connect/*`) — no hotel logic is reimplemented; it builds a ChatGPT-importable **OpenAPI 3.1** spec for 6 operations (`searchHotels`, `getProperty`, `create`/`get`/`modify`/`cancelReservation`)
- **Secure by design** — the gateway injects BAIA's API key server-side (the GPT never sees it), and response guards ensure **only selling prices** reach the model (net/wholesale/cost stripped)
- **PII-scrubbed tool-call logging** for training, with an optional Supabase/Postgres sink
- Host-agnostic — ships as a **Vercel** serverless function, a plain Node server, or a Docker container

### Admin Dashboard
- React SPA including Dashboard, Front Desk, Reservations, Guests, Rooms, Housekeeping, Folios, Groups, **Commercial**, Cashier, House Accounts, Accounting, Tax, Rate Plans, Night Audit, Reports, Channel Manager, Revenue Management, Communications, Reviews, Settings
- Revenue Management page: KPI cards, pending AI recommendations with approve/reject, agent performance metrics, per-agent configuration
- Night Audit page: AI anomaly detection section with severity-coded alerts
- Communications page: email draft preview, send / approve / reject workflow, manual **Run guest-comms** for scheduled drafts, delivery stats
- Reviews page: add reviews, AI-drafted responses, edit/approve/mark-posted workflow, rating stats
- Settings page: property settings (incl. registration-card requirement), photo gallery, plus **Users & Roles administration** (user management + permission matrix)
- Reservations detail: operational notes + compose guest email (GDPR marketing flag enforced server-side)
- Rooms & Room Types: photo galleries with primary/reorder, per-room editable features
- Real-time updates via WebSocket (new reservations, room status changes, AI agent decisions)
- Responsive layout with mobile sidebar drawer
- Calendar view for reservations (day/week/month)
- Housekeeping kanban board
- KPI cards with trend indicators
- Skeleton loading states, toast notifications, error boundaries
- Served as static files in production (single Docker image)

## Quick Start

### 🚀 Try it in one command

The only prerequisite is **Docker**. No Node, no pnpm, no API keys, no config.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TelivityAI/haip.git
cd haip
docker compose up
```

That's it. Compose builds the image, initializes the database, **seeds a full demo
hotel with the AI agents already running**, and serves everything at one URL:

- **Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3000`
- **Swagger / OpenAPI:** `http://localhost:3000/docs`
- **Booking:** `http://localhost:3000/booking/` — live guest booking widget (search → quote → book)
- **Preview page:** `http://localhost:3000/booking-preview.html` — optional static walkthrough of every booking screen

**Wire a shipped or adapter integration in one command** (API must be up):

```bash
./integrations/demos/run.sh list shipped  # 21 product paths
./integrations/demos/run.sh list adapters # 37 console fiscal/guest-reg packs
./integrations/demos/run.sh stripe        # toggle ON + mock/console path
./integrations/demos/run.sh all shipped
```

Each pack has \`GO_LIVE.md\` for live credentials. Details: [\`integrations/demos/\`](./integrations/demos/).

Dashboard UI: English and Deutsch (header language switcher).

The first run builds the image and can take a few minutes; subsequent starts are
fast. A one-shot `init` container pushes the schema and seeds the demo before the
API starts (idempotent — safe to re-run). Auth is **off by default** so you land
straight in the app; to explore the Keycloak login/RBAC flow instead, run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.auth.yml --profile auth up -d --build
```

See [`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md) for production self-host.

> One-click cloud demo: see [Deploy to the cloud](#deploy-to-the-cloud) to spin up
> a hosted instance with zero local setup.

### Production self-host

See **[`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md)** for the full production guide (compose files, env vars, TLS, backups, upgrades, GHCR images).

Quick start:

```bash
cp .env.production.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production — set DATABASE_URL, Stripe keys, Keycloak, CONNECT_API_KEY, etc.

docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml --profile auth up -d --build
```

Auth is on (`AUTH_ENABLED=true`); do not set `BAIA_ALLOW_INSECURE`.

### Local development

For hot-reload development against the source (requires **Node ≥ 20** and **pnpm ≥ 9**):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TelivityAI/haip.git
cd haip

# Start only the infra (Postgres + Redis); add `keycloak` if testing auth
docker compose up -d postgres redis

pnpm install
cp .env.example .env          # defaults work as-is — no keys needed for a demo

pnpm build                    # build workspace packages
pnpm db:migrate               # push schema (same as --filter @telivityhaip/database run migrate)
pnpm seed                     # seed demo data

pnpm dev                                            # API with hot reload (:3000)
pnpm --filter @telivityhaip/dashboard dev           # dashboard dev server (:5173)
pnpm --filter @telivityhaip/booking dev             # booking widget dev server (:5174)
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| API | `http://localhost:3000` |
| Dashboard (dev) | `http://localhost:5173` |
| Booking widget (dev) | `http://localhost:5174` |
| Keycloak (`--profile auth`) | `http://localhost:8080` |

> **Local dev dashboard is `:5173`, not `:3000`.** The API at `:3000` serves Swagger
> and the REST API only unless you set `SERVE_DASHBOARD=true` on the API process.

> Payments default to `STRIPE_MODE=mock` and guest email to draft-only, so no
> Stripe or SMTP credentials are required. Set real keys in `.env` only when you
> want live payments/email.

> **Optional: request-first booking** — STR / coliving properties that need staff
> approval before a reservation can enable `@telivityhaip/booking-requests`
> (`pnpm db:migrate:booking-requests`, then `BAIA_BOOKING_REQUESTS=true`). See
> [`packages/booking-requests/README.md`](./packages/booking-requests/README.md).

### Deploy to the cloud

One-click deploy a hosted demo (provisions Postgres + Redis, builds, migrates, and
seeds automatically) using the included [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) blueprint:

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/TelivityAI/haip)

Any Docker host works too — the [`apps/api/Dockerfile`](./apps/api/Dockerfile)
builds a single image serving the API, dashboard (`/`), and booking engine (`/booking/`) on port 3000.

### Production checklist

Before going live, verify the items in [`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md#required-environment-variables) and [`docs/operations/cron.md`](./docs/operations/cron.md).

### Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| API won't start locally | Is Postgres/Redis up? `docker compose up -d postgres redis` |
| Dashboard empty in local dev | You opened `:3000` instead of `:5173` |
| `migrate` script missing on api package | Use `@telivityhaip/database`, not api: `pnpm db:migrate` |
| Docker API unhealthy | Check init logs: `docker compose logs init` (migrate/seed may have failed) |
| Booking returns 401 with auth on | Copy the booking key from **Settings → Booking Engine** (or pass `?key=` in the URL) |

### Run tests

```bash
# Passing-test count: 2418 test cases across 281 files (skipped excluded)

# API tests only
pnpm --filter @telivityhaip/api test

# Dashboard component tests
pnpm --filter @telivityhaip/dashboard test

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint
```

## Demo Hotel — Telivity Grand Hotel

The seed script creates a fully configured demo property with realistic data:

| Entity | Count | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Property | 1 | Telivity Grand Hotel — 5-star, 40 rooms, Miami Beach, USD, America/New_York |
| Room Types | 4 | Standard King, Deluxe Ocean View, Junior Suite, Penthouse Suite |
| Rooms | 40 | Across 4 floors with real room numbers, mixed statuses, 2 ADA-accessible |
| Rate Plans | 5 | BAR per room type + a seasonal promotional rate, with LOS/weekend restrictions |
| Guests | 15 | Mix of VIP levels (none through diamond), international, loyalty tiers |
| Reservations | 23 | Past, in-house, arrivals, future, no-show, and cancelled |
| Folios | 16 | With charges (room, tax, minibar, spa) and payments |
| Housekeeping Tasks | 18 | Checkout cleans, stayovers, deep cleans, inspections with checklists |
| Tax Profiles | 4 | Miami Beach 13%, Barcelona IVA+tourist, Amsterdam BTW+tourist, Berlin split |
| **BAIA Agents** | **12** | **Enabled in suggest mode — incl. the Revenue Manager orchestrator** |
| **Agent Decisions** | **10** | **A live decision log: revenue strategy, pricing, forecast, overbooking…** |
| **Guest Reviews** | **5** | **Two with AI-drafted responses, the rest awaiting action** |

Everything is populated on first boot, so the dashboard — including the AI layer
(Revenue Manager, agent decision log, review responses) — is alive immediately,
not empty. Use it to explore the API and dashboard right after `docker compose up`.

## OTAIP Integration — Connect API

The Connect API (`/api/v1/connect/`) is purpose-built for [OTAIP](https://github.com/telivity-otaip/otaip) AI agents. It provides higher-level abstractions over the core PMS endpoints, designed for agent workflows.

### Agent Endpoints

```
# Property Search (Agent 4.1 — Hotel Search)
POST   /api/v1/connect/search                      # Search properties by criteria
GET    /api/v1/connect/properties                  # List all properties
GET    /api/v1/connect/properties/:id              # Full property detail

# Booking (Agent 4.5 — Booking)
POST   /api/v1/connect/book                        # Book a room
GET    /api/v1/connect/bookings/:confirmationNumber/verify  # Verify booking
PATCH  /api/v1/connect/bookings/:confirmationNumber # Modify booking
DELETE /api/v1/connect/bookings/:confirmationNumber # Cancel booking

# Event Subscriptions
POST   /api/v1/connect/subscriptions               # Subscribe to events
GET    /api/v1/connect/subscriptions               # List subscriptions
DELETE /api/v1/connect/subscriptions/:id           # Unsubscribe
POST   /api/v1/connect/subscriptions/:id/test      # Test subscription
GET    /api/v1/connect/events                      # Poll for events

# AI Insights
GET    /api/v1/connect/insights/revenue            # Revenue optimization hints
GET    /api/v1/connect/insights/guest-triggers     # Guest communication triggers
GET    /api/v1/connect/insights/housekeeping       # Housekeeping optimization
```

### How OTAIP Connects

OTAIP's `packages/connect` will have a BAIA adapter (like `AmadeusAdapter`, `DuffelAdapter`). Lodging agents (Domain 4) connect to BAIA via this adapter. Both projects share TypeScript, pnpm, Vitest, and strict TS config.

```
OTAIP Agent → ConnectAdapter (BAIA) → Connect API → BAIA PMS → PostgreSQL
```

The PMS is the product. OTAIP agents are the intelligence on top.

> **ChatGPT too** — `tools/haip-connect-gpt` wraps this same Connect API as a ChatGPT Custom GPT Action (OpenAPI 3.1, server-side key injection, selling-price-only responses), so a guest can search and book straight from ChatGPT. See [`tools/haip-connect-gpt/README.md`](./tools/haip-connect-gpt/README.md).

## WebSocket — Real-time Events

BAIA uses Socket.IO for real-time event broadcasting to the dashboard and other connected clients.

```typescript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

// Join a property room to receive its events
socket.emit('joinProperty', { propertyId: 'uuid-here' });

// Listen for events
socket.on('reservation.created', (data) => { /* ... */ });
socket.on('room.status_changed', (data) => { /* ... */ });
socket.on('housekeeping.task_completed', (data) => { /* ... */ });
socket.on('agent.decision_made', (data) => { /* ... */ });
```

### Broadcast Events

All webhook events are simultaneously broadcast via WebSocket to clients subscribed to the relevant property. Events follow the `entity.action` naming convention:

- `reservation.created`, `reservation.checked_in`, `reservation.checked_out`
- `room.status_changed`
- `housekeeping.task_assigned`, `housekeeping.task_completed`, `housekeeping.ai_assigned`
- `folio.charge_posted`
- `channel.sync_completed`
- `agent.decision_made`, `agent.cancellation_forecast_updated`
- `guest.communication_drafted`, `guest.communication_sent`, `guest.review_response_drafted`

## Security & Compliance (Built In, Not Bolted On)

BAIA is multi-tenant by construction, and isolation is enforced **in depth** — at the request boundary *and* the data layer — so a bug in one place isn't a breach.

| Area | How BAIA Handles It |
|------|-------------------|
| **Tenant isolation** | `property_id` on every table. A global guard binds each authenticated request to the `propertyId` it targets (fail-closed), and every property-scoped query independently filters by `propertyId`. Caller-supplied foreign keys are verified to belong to the tenant before any write. |
| **Authentication & authorization** | Keycloak OIDC (RS256 JWT) **plus** BAIA's own local users/roles/permissions; `@Roles` + `@RequirePermissions` guards on every endpoint. The Connect (agent) API uses per-property API credentials stored as hashes; inbound OTA webhooks are authenticated per connection (Basic-Auth / HMAC). |
| **Input & transport hardening** | Strict DTO validation (incl. positive-amount checks on monetary fields and UUID-validated ids), an origin **CORS allowlist**, security response headers, **SSRF protection** on outbound webhooks, and rate limiting. The API **refuses to boot with insecure defaults in production** (auth off / mock payments) unless explicitly opted in for the demo. |
| **PCI DSS** | Never stores raw card data. Stripe tokenization via PaymentIntents. Payments table stores token + last four + brand. |
| **GDPR** | Audit trail (with actor) on every data modification, consent tracking fields, data retention and right-to-erasure APIs. |
| **Guest Registration** | Configurable per jurisdiction. ID verification fields. EU police reporting interface planned. |
| **Tax Calculation** | Jurisdiction-based tax engine. Inclusive/exclusive handling. Sales, occupancy, tourism, and VAT tax types. Per-property rules with exemption support. |

> Security is treated as ongoing work: the codebase is reviewed continuously and hardened as it matures. Before production use, pair it with your own deployment review and a Keycloak configured to issue the `property_ids` claim.

## Integrations

BAIA is **API-first**: the same REST surface that powers the dashboard is documented via auto-generated **OpenAPI 3.0** at `/docs`, state changes fan out through **HMAC-signed webhooks**, and external systems connect through **pluggable adapters** (channels, payments, messaging, accounting, and more).

See **[`docs/INTEGRATIONS.md`](./docs/INTEGRATIONS.md)** for the full integration catalog (~230 integrations across 19 categories). To wire your stack, start with **[`docs/webhooks.md`](./docs/webhooks.md)** (signature verification, payloads, retries) and the recipes under **[`docs/integrations/`](./docs/integrations/)**. **Fiscalization and guest registration** are first-class categories — so properties can plug in invoice issuance and authority reporting without custom one-offs.

## Contributing

BAIA is built in public and contributions are welcome.

### The One Rule

**DO NOT INVENT HOTEL DOMAIN LOGIC.** All hotel domain knowledge must be researched and verified. Do not invent hotel operations logic. If unsure, open an issue. Don't guess — hotels are weirder than you think.

### How to contribute

1. Check the [open issues](https://github.com/TelivityAI/haip/issues)
2. Read `CLAUDE.md` for code standards and conventions
3. Read the relevant KB section before writing business logic
4. Fork, branch, PR — tests required for all business logic
5. One module at a time. Don't boil the ocean.

### Development commands

```bash
pnpm install          # Install dependencies
pnpm build            # Build all workspace packages
pnpm dev              # Start API in dev mode (hot reload)
pnpm test             # Run all tests (2418 passing, 281 files with passes; skipped excluded)
pnpm lint             # ESLint
```

## Hosted booking payment returns

For Redsys booking checkout, configure `BOOKING_RETURN_ORIGINS` with the exact
origins of the pages embedding the booking widget (comma-separated, no wildcard).
For example: `https://hotel.example,https://www.hotel.example`. Production requires
HTTPS. Local development can explicitly allow `http://localhost:5174`. Configure
the corresponding CORS origins for cross-origin widgets as usual.

Run `pnpm db:migrate` before deploying the API changes, including
`0024_payment_authorization_finalization.sql`,
`0025_payment_booking_return_reference.sql`, and
`0026_payment_booking_return_destination.sql`. Follow the
[Redsys credential migration](docs/integrations/payments-redsys.md#existing-installations)
before accepting payments with previously stored signing keys.
The widget sends its full embedding-page URL as
`returnUrl` to `POST /api/v1/booking-engine/book`. The API validates the origin
before creating a guest or reservation, preserves the host path/query/fragment,
and binds both provider outcomes to the same randomly generated return reference.
The booking endpoint no longer accepts separate browser success/failure URLs.

Both provider URLs use the compact API relay
`/api/v1/booking-return/:reference?propertyId=:propertyId`, including for short
hotel URLs. It shares the `PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` configuration used by Redsys
notifications (with the existing `API_BASE_URL` fallback). The server checks the
provider's 250-character URL limit before creating booking records. Full hotel
URLs are stored without the capability and are never truncated. The relay looks
up the capability hash together with the supplied tenant scope, checks expiry and
the destination allowlist again, and issues a non-cacheable 303 to that saved
page with the original reference appended. It accepts no redirect destination or
payment outcome from the browser.

On return, the widget boots directly into its payment-status view without saved
router state or browser storage. It polls
`GET /api/v1/booking-engine/payment-return-status`, using the normal
`x-booking-key` and an `x-payment-return-reference` header. The response contains
only `status`: `processing`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`, or `unavailable`.
Only server payment state determines the result; browser flags are ignored.
`succeeded` reports payment authorization, not unconditional booking confirmation.
The reference expires seven days after payment creation and cannot retrieve guest
details, retrieve a confirmation credential, or cancel a booking.

Keep return references out of application, proxy, and analytics logs; the relay
path reference and the host page's `haip_payment_return` query parameter are
limited bearer capabilities. The relay sets `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`.
Failed, cancelled, or unverified returns direct guests to contact the hotel before
trying again, because an earlier booking or payment may already exist.
