# BAIA Integrations

BAIA is API-first: REST OpenAPI is available at `/docs`, HMAC-signed webhooks cover roughly 90 `entity.action` events with retries, WebSocket keeps operational clients current, and the platform connects to tools hotels use and anything that speaks HTTP.

Resources: [integration recipes](integrations/), [shipped demos](../integrations/demos/) (`./integrations/demos/run.sh <slug>`), and [webhooks](webhooks.md).

## How integrations work

- Webhooks out - `X-BAIA-Signature`, backoff
- REST API in - Connect API API-key scoped
- Pluggable adapters - channel managers, payments, locks, SMS, email
- Open standards - OpenTravel/OTA XML, iCal, SMTP, CSV, SQL PostgreSQL

## Built for compliance, worldwide

Selling rooms is global; receipts and guest registration are local law. BAIA treats government compliance as a first-class integration category across Europe and Latin America: fiscalization and e-invoicing (Italy SDI, Greece myDATA, Poland KSeF, Hungary NAV, Spain VeriFactu/SII, Portugal, Germany TSE, Austria RKSV, the Balkans, Mexico CFDI, Colombia DIAN, Chile, Argentina and more) and mandatory guest registration (Serbia eTurista, Croatia eVisitor, Italy Alloggiati Web, Czechia Ubyport, Spain SES Hospedajes, Hungary VIZA, Finland traveller notification, Colombia SIRE). Where a country has no mandate, or a mandate with no digital channel, that's documented too - no compliance theater.

## Integration catalog

19 categories, ~230 integrations, phased: automation/notifications/email/BI/standards first; vendor adapters next; certified distribution and country compliance as onboarding/market entry demand.

### Catalog status (registry)

The property Integrations dashboard / `GET /api/v1/admin/integrations` uses four statuses — **not** “only shipped counts”:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `shipped` | In-product path you can enable (payments, channels, locks, SMS/email, etc.) |
| `adapter` | Provider key wired (often console/demo until partner credentials / authority clients) |
| `recipe` | Works today via docs + existing REST/webhooks/CSV/SQL — no vendor SDK required |
| `planned` | Partner/cert or country pack not started yet |

The flat list below is the full public surface. Registry seed status is the maturity filter on top of that list.
