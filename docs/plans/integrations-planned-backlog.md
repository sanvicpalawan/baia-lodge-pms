# Planned integrations backlog (collaborator build plan)

**Audience:** engineers helping ship the remaining catalog rows.
**Source of truth:** `packages/database/src/schema/integration-registry-seed.ts` (`status: planned`).
**Counts (verify on `main` before claiming):** regenerate with the script note below — do not hand-edit totals blindly.

This file lists **86** planned integrations that are **not** yet `shipped` / `adapter` / `recipe`.
Usable rows already on `main` are documented in [wave3-partner-surface.md](../integrations/wave3-partner-surface.md) and [`integrations/demos/`](../../integrations/demos/).

---

## Grounding rules (non-negotiable)

1. **Do not invent vendor or government API contracts.** If partner docs / KB are missing, STOP and ask.
2. Every property-scoped table/query filters `propertyId` (BAIA multi-tenancy).
3. Status honesty: `shipped` only for real HTTP-capable paths; `adapter` for console handoffs; `recipe` for docs on existing REST/webhooks/CSV/SQL; leave `planned` until one of those is true.
4. Every promoted row needs: registry flip (`status` / `adapterKey` / `docsPath`) + `integrations/demos/<slug>/` (`demo.sh` + `GO_LIVE.md` + README) + manifest entry.
5. One PR per coherent slice (category or small cluster). Cut branches from current `main` with **only that slice’s commits** (repo branch freeze on `main` only — force-push on `cursor/*` is OK).
6. Compliance-22 packs: follow [compliance-market-entry.md](../integrations/compliance-market-entry.md) — never claim free automated authority filing.

## Done when (per slug)

- [ ] Works without inventing vendor keys (console / recipe / mock OK)
- [ ] `./integrations/demos/run.sh <slug>` succeeds against local stack
- [ ] `GO_LIVE.md` lists live env / partner steps
- [ ] Registry seed `status` (+ `adapterKey` when applicable) matches reality
- [ ] Public docs under `docs/integrations/` updated; link from [integrations README](../integrations/README.md)
