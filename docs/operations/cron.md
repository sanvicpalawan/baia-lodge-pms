# Scheduled operations (external cron)

BAIA does not run in-process cron jobs. Use an external scheduler (system cron, Kubernetes CronJob, GitHub Actions, etc.) to call these authenticated API endpoints on a schedule.

All requests require a valid Keycloak JWT with the appropriate role unless noted.

Base URL: `https://<your-host>/api/v1`

## Night audit

Run once per property per business date (typically after midnight local time).

```
POST /night-audit/run
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "propertyId": "<uuid>", "businessDate": "2026-07-01" }
```

Role: `admin` or `night_auditor`

## AI agent training

Train all enabled agents on property history (recommended nightly).

```
POST /agents/<propertyId>/train-all
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Role: `admin`

## AI agent runs (orchestration)

BAIA does not run in-process agent cron. Use `scripts/cron/agent-runs.sh <agentType>` (or call the API directly).

```
POST /agents/<propertyId>/<agentType>/run?triggeredBy=schedule
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Role: `admin`

### Default schedule matrix

| Trigger | Agents | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| `0 6 * * *` | `revenue_manager` | Owns revenue cadence; pulls demand + levers |
| `0 6 * * *` | `ar_collections` | Daily ops / commercial |
| `0 8 * * *` | `housekeeping` | Daily ops window |
| `0 */6 * * *` | `cancellation` | Every 6 hours |
| `0 23 * * *` | `night_audit` | Before night-audit close |
| `0 7 * * *` | `guest_comms` | Pre-arrival, day-of, delayed post-stay, win-back |
| `0 * * * *` | Review ingest | `POST /reviews/ingest?propertyId=<uuid>` per property |
| Events | `guest_comms`, `review_response` | Reservation lifecycle (confirmation, welcome) / review ingest |
| Manual | Any specialist + RManager | Dashboard **Run Now** or `triggeredBy=manual` |

**Do not** independently cron `demand_forecast`, `pricing`, `overbooking`, `channel_mix`, or `group_pickup` — they run via RManager and would double-fire. See [`docs/agents-orchestration.md`](../agents-orchestration.md).

## Group block cutoffs (auto-release sweep)

Release all blocks past their cutoff date for a property. Run daily (typically after night audit).

```
POST /groups/blocks/process-cutoffs?propertyId=<uuid>
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Role: `admin`, `night_auditor`, or `revenue_manager`

## Group allotment release (single block)

Release unsold group inventory for one block (call from night audit workflow or on demand).

```
POST /groups/blocks/<blockId>/release?propertyId=<uuid>
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Role: `admin`, `front_desk`, or `revenue_manager`

## Channel ARI push (optional)

Push availability/rates to connected OTAs (daily or on-demand).

```
POST /channels/push/full
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "propertyId": "<uuid>",
  "channelConnectionId": "<uuid>",
  "startDate": "2026-07-01",
  "endDate": "2026-07-31"
}
```

Role: `admin`

## Health check (unauthenticated)

```
GET /health
```

Use for load balancer / uptime monitoring.

## Review ingest (scheduled pull)

Pull configured review sources (Google Places, TripAdvisor) into `guest_reviews` with dedupe. Run hourly per property when integrations are enabled.

```
POST /reviews/ingest?propertyId=<uuid>
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Role: `admin`, `general_manager`, or `night_auditor`

Channex OTA reviews can also arrive via `POST /channels/inbound/channex/reviews` (event `review`) without polling.
